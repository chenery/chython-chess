# chython-chess

Chive-chess written/ported in/to Python from Java.

## Notes on the use of Python

- Name your classes and functions consistently; the convention is to use CamelCase for classes and 
lower_case_with_underscores for functions and methods.
- Documentations & comments - https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/
- Dynamic typing (types checked at runtime). 
- Duck typing - the object suitability (Java speak - instance of) is determined by presence of required methods and 
properties at runtime.

- Lambda Expressions - anonymous functions created with the 'lambda' keyword

- 'Functional' scope - see also global and non-local statements to access beyond the current scope

- classes - no private variables - use __ prefix as convention to indicate private

- unitttest - tests must start with the letters 'test'

- Tuples - immutable
